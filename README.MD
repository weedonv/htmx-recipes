htmx poc

project details:
* java 17
* springboot 3.1.4
* ./mvnw clean install
* GOTO: http://localhost:8080/recipes

future ideas:
* expand functionality of recipes, add maybe the original picture from recipe book
* create medicinal recipes table, dosage, volumes, units of measurement, duration of treatment etc... (stuff like hawthorn tea)
