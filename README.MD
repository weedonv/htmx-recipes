*Hello*

*For my take home I'd like to demonstrate the htmx framework,
I've recently discovered it and mentioned it in the first interview,
this is the first time im coding anything in it,
but it could be very important for the following reasons:*

1. Allows rapid prototyping of modern web apps
2. Allows backend devs to circumvent using JS
3. Its fast and small
4. Its gained a lot of popularity in python and Go circles. Java people starting to notice.
5. With the advent of java 21's project loom + virtual threads, server side html rendering could become the standard again.
6. I wanted to put my money where my mouth is (said I could pick up new concepts fast, never used htmx and thymeleaf only a small amount)


I hope we can have some interesting discussions about this tech and its potential.
Potential uses:
1. POC's
2. Give internal tools a UI component
3. MicroSites/MicroFrontEnds
4. Temporary/Campaign Sites
5. Simpler sites that just don't need a heavy js framework
6. It's not a replacement for a rich and interactive react website, but it certainly seems better suited for some tasks.

project details:
* java 17
* springboot 3.1.4
* ./mvnw clean install
* GOTO: http://localhost:8080/recipes

future ideas:
* expand functionality of recipes, add maybe the original picture from recipe book
* create medicinal recipes table, dosage, volumes, units of measurement, duration of treatment etc... (stuff like hawthorn tea)
